## How to Use Python

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its readability and simplicity. This guide will introduce you to the basics of using Python.

## Prerequisites

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, follow the instructions on the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Step 1: Install Python

1. Visit the official Python download page: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

   - **Windows:** Download the executable installer.
   - **macOS:** Download the macOS installer.
   - **Linux:** Use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3` for Ubuntu).

3. Follow the installation instructions, and make sure to check the box to add Python to your system's PATH.

## Step 2: Verify Installation

To confirm that Python has been installed correctly, open your terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
python --version
```

or for macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see the version number of Python printed in the terminal.

## Step 3: Write Your First Python Script

1. Create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-python-project
   cd my-python-project
   ```

2. Create a new Python file (e.g., `hello.py`):

   ```bash
   touch hello.py
   ```

3. Open the `hello.py` file in your preferred code editor and add the following sample code:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

## Step 4: Run the Python Script

To execute your Python script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

or for macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Step 5: Using Python in Interactive Mode

Python also provides an interactive mode where you can execute commands directly. To enter the interactive mode, just type:

```bash
python
```

or for macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3
```

You can now enter Python commands one by one. For example:

```python
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> print("Hello from interactive mode!")
Hello from interactive mode!
```

To exit interactive mode, type `exit()` or press `Ctrl + Z` (Windows) or `Ctrl + D` (macOS/Linux).


You have successfully installed Python and run your first Python script! Python's extensive libraries and frameworks allow you to build a wide range of applications. For more information and resources, visit the official Python documentation at [https://docs.python.org/](https://docs.python.org/).
